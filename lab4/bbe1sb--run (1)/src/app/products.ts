    description: 'The dynamic driver developed by Apple uses a special amplifier, providing incredible sound detail. You will clearly hear the entire spectrum — from deep, rich bass to crystal clear high notes. The built-in microphones in each earphone are covered with a special acoustic grid. This allows you to minimize the noise from the wind during calls, so that you can always be clearly and clearly heard. The new push sensor supports even more control options: turn on and stop playback, rewind tracks, answer calls and end them. The earphone case is easy to charge with a MagSafe charger.3 When the case is fully charged, the headphones work for up to 30 hours in a row.4 And if the AirPods are completely discharged, just five minutes in the case is enough — and you can listen to music for about an hour.'

    description: 'AirPods Pro are unique headphones with active noise reduction technology that continuously optimize the sound taking into account the shape of your ear and the position of the earbuds. They perfectly drown out external noises, so you can completely immerse yourself in the music. These are headphones of a completely new class. AirPods Pro are exceptionally comfortable, they have active noise reduction technology, and you can even choose earbuds of your own size. You will feel the music better, not the headphones. The set includes three pairs of soft silicone earbuds, which are easily fixed on the earphone. A special test will help you choose the size of the earbuds for optimal fit and better sound. There is a special conical cavity inside each earbud, which helps it adapt better to the geometry of the ear and hold the earphone more securely. And the holes in the earbuds allow you to equalize the pressure, so the headphones will be for you. With periodic recharging in the MagSafe case, the headphones can work for more than 24 hours. The case is compatible with various chargers — including those that support MagSafe technology, which makes wireless charging faster and more convenient. When the battery runs out, AirPods Pro sends a notification about it to your iPhone.'
